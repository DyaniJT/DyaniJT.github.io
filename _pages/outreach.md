### Public Engagement With Research and Nature

### Reaching Broader Audiences 

At Cornell, I've been lucky to have the opportunity to learn about broader engagement while affiliated with the [Lab of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/), which functions as a hub for pairing excellent basic science with effective public communication and advocacy for issues that influence birds. In 2019-20, I worked with [Maren Vitousek](https://vitousek.weebly.com/), [Monique Pipkin](https://vitousek.weebly.com/people.html), and [Mya Thompson](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/staff/mya-thompson/) to write a script for an animated short inspired by some of our research on tree swallows. With funding to Maren from the National Science Foundation, we were able to hire an animator and turn this script into a professionally produced video that has been shared widely, including with the worldwide contact list that the Lab of Ornithology maintains. We also envision the video as being a useful teaching tool for high school and introductory college courses and I'm excited to see this video reaching a large audience!
