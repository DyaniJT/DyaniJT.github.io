### Book Project

I am writing a book titled *Gendered Seascapes and Monarchy in Early Modern English Culture*, which explores seascapes, including figures of coastlines, ships and wrecks, naval war, and stormy seas, that writers across centuries have used to propose systems of authority and to warn readers about threats to governing structures. I argue that early modern seascapes often posit a hierarchical, gendered relationship between pilot and ship or human and environment; for example, the ideal monarch is like a pilot who controls the ship-like state or the ideal husband pilots his ship-like wife. Yet queer figures and models of human-nonhuman collaboration—such as male bodies compared to pregnant sails or a monarch who is a pilot and also a wind, an island, or a harbor—disrupt top-down, patriarchal systems of governance.

The book analyzes seascapes that appear in a range of well- and lesser-known plays, poems, narrative fictions, sermons, and pamphlets from 1580-1688, including Shakespeare’s *The Tempest* and Margaret Cavendish’s *Blazing World*. Each chapter discusses critical questions that arise from the focus of the figures under examination, beginning with cultural debates concerning monarchy and moving to those about pregnancy, marriage, and political conflict. By analyzing depictions of collaborations between human and nonhuman elements that represent potential social and political collaborations, my project illuminates how maritime studies can provide new evidence for the centrality of gender and sexuality in early modern theorizations of governance. I take gender as a crucial but under-researched concept in maritime studies; gendered ideologies subtend human conceptualizations of their relationship and obligations to the maritime world.
