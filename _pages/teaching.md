### Teaching Philosophy

My goal in the classroom is to create lively, productive conversations by inviting students to share and broaden their experiences through close encounters with complex texts. In my summer courses at Skidmore College, high-achieving high school students from under-served communities learned alongside current Skidmore students and adults from the Saratoga community. At UC Davis, I worked with international students, non-native English speakers, parents, students returning to college after other careers, those with disabilities, and those from different racial, economic, and cultural backgrounds. I have continued to teach students from all of these backgrounds, first at Ithaca College and now at Colby College, both of which are majority white and majority young-adult communities; I use collaborative learning practices that I have developed in response to my students and that encourage diverse perspectives in my classrooms.

Close analysis of a broad range of texts forms the core of each of my courses, and we support our close textual work with individual and group research projects. My students’ close readings become a foundation for their work as sophisticated readers and writers, whether they are comparing disparate texts, gathering evidence to support their claims, or placing their ideas in relation to those of classmates and experts. These skills are central to literary study, and also to students’ engagement as citizens within and beyond college.

### Spring 2022 Courses 

- **Pirates and Captives in Early Modern Romance:** Pirates, slaves, and shipwrecks are ever present in romances from the 16th and 17th centuries. We will place representations of these figures from ballads, plays, poems, and prose fiction—including texts by William Shakespeare, Miguel de Cervantes, Mary Wroth, and Margaret Cavendish—alongside historical accounts of captivity, forced migration, and environmental violence in both the Mediterranean and the Atlantic worlds. We’ll examine early modern discourses about race, class, gender, and ability and the ways in which our texts sometimes reinforce and sometimes challenge social prejudices. Through a variety of reading, writing, creative, discursive, and analytical assignments, this course will contribute to the following English department learning outcomes: reading and making across genres, platforms, and media; understanding how representation shapes the world; bring both analytical and creative skills to global histories and ecological challenges.

- **Foundations of Literary Studies:** The central purpose of this course is to introduce you, as per the title, to the foundations of literary studies; that is, our task will be to discuss and practice how to read and write about literature according to the conventions of the academic discipline of literary studies. To approach this task, we will read widely across the various kinds of literature—poetry, drama, novels—written in English in time periods from the medieval to the twenty-first century. We will define key disciplinary terms and concepts and put them to use in analytical close readings of our texts. We’ll consider some authoritative answers to the question “What is Literature?” and we’ll attempt some answers of our own. I want to explore with you not just how to read literature but also why we might want or need to do so. Is literature transformative? If so, how does that transformation happen? Is it mysterious and magical or just a trick? What are writers after when they depict alchemy, an old science (that is, scientia or method of knowledge) preoccupied with the transformation of one thing into another? Is reading or writing like that? What can we do with literature and what does it do to—or with—us? With “transformation,” what other trans* ideas might literature enable us to feel or experience or describe?
