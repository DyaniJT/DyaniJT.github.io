    title: "Teaching Philosophy"
    text: "The most effective learning occurs when students are actively engaged in defining their own questions, allowed to make mistakes, and encouraged to work through those mistakes to arrive at a genuine understanding of difficult concepts. This type of experiential learning is demanding for both instructors and students, but I am committed to providing a challenging and engaging learning experience to each of my students both when designing my classes and when mentoring independent research students. Asking students to propose and struggle with their own questions approximates the process of scientific discovery that practicing scientists actually follow. When undergraduate biology students are guided into taking control of their own learning, they cultivate the independence and self-motivation that graduate schools and professional careers in biology demand. Creating opportunities for genuine scientific discovery through class work is challenging, but the best teachers that I have had often accomplish this task by employing active learning strategies, such as ‘flipped’ classrooms and by developing open-ended assignments that use real datasets for lab activities in which students have the opportunity to develop and test original hypotheses."
