**Brianna Johnson** was a summer research intern on the tree swallow project. After the field season, she conducted independent research during the academic year using samples that she helped to collect. Her project focused on measuring the density of feather barbs from nestling tree swallows to address questions about trad-offs between rapid development and feather quality. The project was inspired by a [recent paper](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/702856?casa_token=yRDM_ddHgH4AAAAA%3AXryxDOeRMYLtD7QBa_R2x18-8fQ8SDp7fF18kR9sl-Qbd7F0AWxDz3-6L_9Vtefcyb1XhpUQFWk) demonstrating this trade-off in a comparative study across many species. We are curious if the same trade-off can be seen within a species with an especially long period in the nest and where nest predation is relatively low. Brianna's project also involved cross fostering nestlings at each nest so that we can separate the degree to which genetics vs. environmental conditions contribute to difference in feather quality.
