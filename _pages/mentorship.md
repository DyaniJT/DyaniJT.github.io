### Mentoring in the Field

Add a general paragraph here.

### Training in the Lab

Introduce variety of research projects.

### Formalized Mentorship Program

Since 2018 I have worked with graduate students [Jenny Uehling]() and [Jenn Houtz]() to formalize a mentorship training experience for students involved in the tree swallow project. 

Professional development, 

The goal of this 

### Recent Student Projects

Throughout my research career I have worked with many students who participated in field or lab research and then went on to develop independent research projects for credit or as a thesis project during the academic year. Below is a sample of recent projects that I have supervised working with students at Cornell University.

{%include figure image_path="/assets/images/brianna.jpg" alt="" caption="" %} **Brianna Johnson** was a summer research intern on the tree swallow project. After the field season, she conducted independent research during the academic year using samples that she helped to collect. Her project focused on measuring the density of feather barbs from nestling tree swallows to address questions about trad-offs between rapid development and feather quality. The project was inspired by a [recent paper](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/702856?casa_token=yRDM_ddHgH4AAAAA%3AXryxDOeRMYLtD7QBa_R2x18-8fQ8SDp7fF18kR9sl-Qbd7F0AWxDz3-6L_9Vtefcyb1XhpUQFWk) demonstrating this trade-off in a comparative study across many species. We are curious if the same trade-off can be seen within a species with an especially long period in the nest and where nest predation is relatively low. Brianna's project also involved cross fostering nestlings at each nest so that we can separate the degree to which genetics vs. environmental conditions contribute to difference in feather quality.

{%include figure image_path="/assets/images/allison_anker.jpg" alt="" caption="" %} **Allison Anker** was a summer intern and continued on during the academic year doing independent research. She developed a project watching and scoring behavior from videos of tree swallow nest boxes that she helped record the in the field the previous summer. We had [previously found](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YTujZDQgugIg38Rv7qhFPs0BTKlN_6vz/view) that tree swallows make frequent visits to other nest boxes in the population using an RFID sensor network. The sensor network doesn't give us much information about what actually happend during those interactions. Allison's project was focused on identifying and scoring behavior at those interactions to help interpret the larger RFID dataset. She also scored parental provisioning behavior and nestling squabbles at the box entrance to get a better understanding of how to interpret RFID data from nestlings suggesting that nestlings may compete to sit in the nest box entrance. Allison found that the nestling at the entrance when parents arrived with food was the one who got fed nearly 100% of the time.
