I write and teach about early modern literature, working at the intersection of gender studies and the maritime humanities, with explorations into environmental justice and premodern critical race studies. I have written essays on Spenser, Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Margaret Cavendish, Hester Pulter, and Chaucer, and I am currently writing a book titled *Gendered Seascapes and Monarchy in Early Modern English Culture*.
