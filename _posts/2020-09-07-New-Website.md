I've been needing to update my website for a long time and I finally took the plunge and dove into working with Jekyll & Minimal Mistakes so I can host the website on GitHub rather than Wix where I've had a site for a long time. I'm not planning to update this with blog posts regularly, but I may use this landing page for brief news announcements or highlighting new papers, etc. I'm still working on updating some of the other pages, but most content should be filled in soon.
