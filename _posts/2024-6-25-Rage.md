I've got a new essay out (I'm a little late to the announcement game here) in an edited volume titled, fabulously, [*Water and Cognition in Early Modern English Literature*](https://www.aup.nl/en/book/9789463724791/water-and-cognition-in-early-modern-english-literature). My lovely department put the cover up alongside my colleagues' books; it's lovely to be among friends!

I'm so excited to be a part of this volume, which is brimming with smart, complex, slow, multiple, generous, and generative thinking about *thinking* and water in well-known and lesser known early modern texts and cultural artifacts. The editing process, guided by Steve Mentz and Nic Helms, was remarkably smooth (sailing... sorry!) and I learned so much from reading my colleages' chapters. Some of us got to toast the book in person this spring at the Shakespeare Association of America meeting in Portland, OR. 

If you don't have institutional access, please email me and I'll send a copy of my chapter, "Estuarial Rage and Resistance in Hester Pulter's 'The Complaint of Thames.'"
