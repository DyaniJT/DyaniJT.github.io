I was lucky to have a small Shakespeare and Injustice class this semester, and lucky to have a great set of students who were willing to build community, learn from each other, and humor my experiment in final project creation: they worked together to brainstorm, craft, and create a project that grew from our work in class and from their individual site-specific performance and adaptation projects. 

[I think it came out beautifully!](https://arcg.is/1SyeyO0) Cheers to Philip, Maisie, Kate, Dorian, Zaina, and Julie for all of their hard work and laughter and learning!
