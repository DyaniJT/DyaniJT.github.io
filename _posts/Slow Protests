My new article is out in a special issue of the journal *Coastal Studies & Society*! Hurrah! Parts of this article date all the way back to a seminar paper I wrote in graduate school. It's wild to see how long it can sometimes take to incubate and evolve an idea. And I most certainly couldn't have done it alone: Margie Ferguson read that first early draft, participants in my seminar at the 2019 Renaissance Society of America conference in Toronto asked me important questions, my Omohondro Institute Coffeehouse fellows kick-started my revision process last year, Steve Mentz and Chris Pastore gave me the opportunity to be a part of the special issue, and Isaac Land and the amazing readers and team at *Coastal Studies & Society* provided invaluable feedback. I'm feeling grateful and humbled to be in such an amazing lineup in the issue itself! 

[Doesn't it look pretty!?] So glad to have it out in the world. If you don't have intitutional access, contact me and I can send you a copy!
