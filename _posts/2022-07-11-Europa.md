The Folger Shakespeare library invited me to write a guest post for their blog, *The Collation*! It was a great cap to my academic year, during which I was a short-term fellow at the Folger as well as the Omohundro Institute Fellow for 21-22. [Check Out](https://collation.folger.edu/2022/07/europa-into-the-waves/) what I wrote!
